        This is not a conference. It is a weekend in the mountains, with serious hiking and bunk bed sleeping.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        It is an occasion to really deeply connect with fellow entrepreneurs and investors, but most of all to feel the pull of nature,
        enjoying the silence and solitude that you can only get by being in the middle of the mountains.

        The event is deliberately light in its schedule, to maximize the amount of time you can spend actually getting to know the
        other participants, as well as meditating with yourself.
